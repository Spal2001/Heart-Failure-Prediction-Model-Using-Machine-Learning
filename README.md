# Heart-Failure-Prediction-Model-Using-Machine-Learning
This project predicts heart failure cases successfully for most of the cases.
This is a Supervised classification Machine Learning model that predicts heart failure cases on the basis of Age, Cholesterol, Resting blood pressure, maximum heart rate etc.
The data set for this project is taken from Kaggle.
This project is build using Python language.
The libraries that are used includes: 
pandas and numpy -> for data preprocessing
matplotlib -> for data visualization
sklearn(scikit learn) -> For model building
The Machine Learning that is used for training the model is Logistic Regression.
The accuracy of the model is about 85.71%
